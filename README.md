2. Final Project (60%)

## Final Project

This repository is for the final project of Pattern Recognition.

It's based on the paper [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf).

And the tutorials from [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) from TensorFlow.
